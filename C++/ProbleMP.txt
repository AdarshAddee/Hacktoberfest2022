Write a program to count the number of Setbit (1s)  in the binary representation of T  integers.

INPUT 
FIRST LINE WILL BE  NO OF TESTCASE REPRESENTS BY LET SAY = T
FURTHER NEXT LINE WILL TAKE  T  INTEGERS 
OUTPUT WILL BE NO OF SETBITS PRESENT  IN EACH INTEGERS  BINARY REPRESENTATION

TESTCASES  WOULDBE  LIKE
INPUT :
3
7
13
6
OUTPUT
3
3
2


T : NO OF TESTCASES

EXPLANATION

Input : n = 7
Output : 3
Binary representation of 7 is 111 and has 3 set bits

Input : n = 13
Output : 3
Binary representation of 13 is 1101 and has 3 set bits

Input : n = 6
Output : 2
Binary representation of 6 is 111 and has 3 set bits
